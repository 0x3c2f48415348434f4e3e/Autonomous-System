# Autonomous System
Considering creating an autonomous system (Self-driving car, although not entirely a production type car). Might
seem like an impossible task, but at least i will learn something new along the way.
Decided using a fully production car will be a lot harder and expensive, and if for example i was a to use an alternative such as an RC car, it will be less expensive, and inaddition, the process will be similar meanding transistion from using RC tp a full production car will not be of a big jump.
# Objective
- [ ] Thorough research about self-driving car

# What is an Autonomous system
AN autonomous system is a system that can automomous conduct a certsain task withount the interverance of a human. Now not all autonoous sytem are fully autonomous, as there are some level of autonomoy within a system.

# What is a self-driving car
Essentially, a self-driving car is a system that is able to autonomously go from apth A to path B without the inteverance of a human

# Robotics
The first field related to an autonomous sytem is robotics. Essentially, Robotics is the study of the mechaniocal manipulation of a system. Robotic integrreates mecahnism, locomotion, sensors, computer vision and actuators into one.
